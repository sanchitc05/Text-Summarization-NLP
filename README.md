# Text-Summarization-NLP  

This project demonstrates **extractive text summarization** techniques using Python's **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** and **Gensim**. Extractive summarization identifies the most important sentences from a given text, allowing users to quickly understand the essence of the content. This repository contains two implementations:  

1. **Gensim-based Summarization**  
2. **Custom NLTK-based Summarization**

## Features  
- **Extractive Summarization using Gensim**: Uses Gensim's `summarize()` function to generate concise summaries.  
- **Custom Summarization using NLTK**: Tokenizes the text, removes stopwords, and scores sentences based on word frequency to generate summaries.  
- **Comparison of Two Methods**: Easily compare Gensim’s model with a custom NLTK-based approach.  
- **Customizable Parameters**: Modify summary length and scoring logic according to your needs.

## Installation  

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, follow the steps below:  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanchitc05/Text-Summarization-NLP.git
   cd Text-Summarization-NLP
   ```

2. Install the required packages:  
   ```bash
   pip install nltk gensim
   ```

3. Download NLTK resources:  
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```

---

## Usage  

1. Add your input text to the `text` variable in the code.  
2. Run the script to see summaries generated by both Gensim and the custom implementation.  

```bash
python summarization.py
```

Example Output:  
```
Gensim Summary:
[Generated Summary]

Custom Summary:
[Generated Summary]
```

## Functions Explained  

### 1. `extractive_summarization_gensim(text)`  
- **Description**: Uses Gensim's built-in `summarize()` function to extract a summary.  
- **Parameter**:  
  - `text`: Input text to be summarized.  
- **Returns**: A summary with 20% of the original text length.  

### 2. `extractive_summarization_custom(text)`  
- **Description**:  
  Custom implementation using NLTK. It creates a frequency table of words, scores each sentence, and selects the top 3 most relevant sentences.  
- **Parameter**:  
  - `text`: Input text to be summarized.  
- **Returns**: A summary consisting of the top-scoring sentences.  

---

## Benefits  
- **Quick Overview**: Get concise summaries from lengthy articles or documents.  
- **Easy to Implement and Compare**: Offers two summarization approaches for comparison.  
- **Highly Customizable**: Modify stopword lists, sentence selection logic, and summary ratio to suit your needs.  
- **Scalable**: Can be integrated into larger NLP applications such as chatbots, recommendation systems, or content summarizers.
